* It’s normal to write shitty code when you start
* foo, baz, bar??? Its normal to be confused
* Global options in R
* on.exit / withr
* dot-dot-dot
* switch takes code blocks
* tempdir: per session folder, the same across calls (pitfall)
  - dir.create(tempfile) => to create subfolder
* create a function in R (beginners) (standard + anonymous)
* create a function in R (advanced)
* several ways to call a function in R (anonymous, infix, prefix, do.call)
* functions all around you
* <- vs. <<- vs. assign 
* assignment functions `class<-` 
  - advanced: usage in pipe mtcars |> `rownames<-`(NULL), list() |> `class<-`("my_class")
* modifying dot dot dot “directly” possible?
* pass by value vs reference
* S3 classes
* Generic functions

  *	Clone repo, branch, build feature, add docs
  *	Add tests, check 
  *	Create PR
* Package dev
