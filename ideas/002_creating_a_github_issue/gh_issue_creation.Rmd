feat: vectorize index arg in remove_slide()

Happy New Year!
  
  I tried to delete several slides at once from a presentation I imported and noticed that the `index` arg in `remove_slide()` is not vectorized.

I suggest to make the `index` arg vectorized. Please feel free to assign the issue to me, @davidgohel, if you agree. :)

``` r
library(officer) 

x <- read_pptx() |> add_slide() |> add_slide() |> add_slide()
x <- remove_slide(x, 1) # works
x <- remove_slide(x, 1:2) # fails => would be nice if it was possible
#> Error in if (!between(index, 1, l_)) {: the condition has length > 1
```
